# predict-score-by-reading-hours
This project was used to predict to score of a set of students by the hours they study for their exams. The linear regression model was used for this prediction

Introduction: In this data science project, we aimed to predict the scores of a group of students based on the number of hours they spent reading. We employed a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between reading hours and scores and determine its predictive capabilities. By leveraging this analysis, our goal was to gain insights into the influence of reading habits on academic performance and create a tool for estimating students' scores based on their reading hours.

Data Collection and Preprocessing: To undertake this project, we collected a dataset comprising information about students' reading hours and corresponding scores.

The data preprocessing stage involved cleaning and organizing the dataset. We addressed missing values, eliminated outliers, and standardized the data to ensure uniformity and facilitate accurate model training. Additionally, we partitioned the dataset into training and testing sets, with the former used for model training and the latter for evaluating its performance

Model Training and Evaluation: Linear regression was chosen as the predictive model for this project due to its simplicity and interpretability. The model assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable (reading hours) and the dependent variable (scores), enabling us to quantify the impact of reading hours on students' academic performance

Results and Insights:
The results of our linear regression analysis provided valuable insights into the impact of reading hours on students' scores. The coefficients associated with reading hours indicated the direction and magnitude of this influence. A positive coefficient indicated that an increase in reading hours corresponded to an increase in scores, while a negative coefficient signified an inverse relationship.

Furthermore, the significance of the coefficients was assessed through statistical tests, such as hypothesis testing and p-values. This helped us determine whether the relationship between reading hours and scores was statistically significant, offering further confidence in the model's predictive capabilities.

Conclusion:
This data science project successfully employed a linear regression model to predict students' scores based on their reading hours. The results not only provided a tool for estimating scores but also shed light on the importance of reading habits in academic performance.
